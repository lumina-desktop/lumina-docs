*************

The |lumina| Configuration utility, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <lumina3>`, is used to configure every aspect of the
desktop and is the recommended way to make changes. To launch this
utility, click
:menuselection:`Start menu --> Preferences --> Configure Desktop`, or
right-click the desktop and hover over :guilabel:`Preferences` and click
:guilabel:`All Desktop Settings`, or type :command:`lumina-config` in a
Command Line Interface (CLI). If all those options are unavailable,
the *Desktop Configuration*
application (under the :guilabel:`Settings` category) also opens

section of the right-click menu also lists the commonly used
sub-elements of **Screensaver**, **Wallpaper**, and **Display** from
within the Configuration utility.

   Desktop Theme settings

It is possible to create personalized theme templates or color schemes
by clicking :guilabel:`Edit` next to those options and changing the
settings as necessary. :numref:`Figure %s <lumina18>` shows an example

When making changes, be sure to click :guilabel:`Save` to save the theme
without closing the editor, or click :guilabel:`Apply`, which both saves
the theme and closes the editor.

.. figure:: images/lumina21c.png
   :scale: 100%

   Session Locale Tab

The **lumina-i18n** package provides localization files. Once installed,
this allows customization of the locale used for the various items
listed in :numref:`Figure %s <lumina21>`. To install this package on a
|trueos| or FreeBSD system, type
:command:`sudo pkg install lumina-i18n`.
On other operating systems, use the default software management tool.
Since each setting has its own drop-down menu, there is flexibility to
select different locales for each item shown in this screen. If any
changes are made in the :guilabel:`Locale` tab, click
:guilabel:`Save Changes` and restart |lumina| to load the configured
locales.

Installing the **lumina-i18n** package also adds a drop-down menu to
the :guilabel:`Preferences` area of the start menu. |lumina| must be
restarted after the package installation before the locale menu is
visible in :guilabel:`Preferences`. This drop-down menu changes the
locale for the current session only. This immediately changes the
localization of any translated menu items without requiring a restart
of |lumina|.

.. note:: If using |lumina| with a language other than English, any menu
          items that continue to be displayed in English have not yet
          been translated to the selected language. To assist the
          |lumina| Project with translating menu items, see
          :ref:`Interface Translation`.
